# Create a dataframe with file names and hierarchical clustering results
hierarchical_df <- data.frame(File = files, Cluster = cutree(hc, 2))

# Create a dataframe with file names and k-means clustering results
kmeans_df <- data.frame(File = files, Cluster = kclustering$cluster)

# Merge the two dataframes on the "File" column
combined_df <- merge(hierarchical_df, kmeans_df, by = "File", all = TRUE)

# Print the combined dataframe
cat("Combined Clustering Results:\n")
print(combined_df)

```
I create the data.frame with result to make better comparison. However i recognized that both clustering method named the clusters oppositely. Thus i changed the numbers for k-means clustering.


```{r}
# Swap values in the "Cluster.y" column
combined_df$Cluster.y <- ifelse(combined_df$Cluster.y == 1, 2, 1)

# Print the updated combined dataframe
cat("Updated Combined Clustering Results:\n")
print(combined_df)
```
```{r}
# Find rows where Cluster.x and Cluster.y do not match
mismatched_rows <- combined_df[combined_df$Cluster.x != combined_df$Cluster.y, ]

# Print the mismatched rows
print(mismatched_rows)
```
The majority of files are clustered consistently between Hierarchical and KMeans Clustering. However five files (listed above ) are identified as mismatched between the Hierarchical Clustering and K-means Clustering results. 

The mismatched files indicate differences in how the two clustering methods assigned these particular documents to clusters. The files may have characteristics that make them ambiguous or challenging for clustering algorithms to group consistently.

```{r}

# Print the counts for each cluster
cat("\nCount of files in each cluster:\n")
for (i in 1:2) {
  cat("Cluster", i, "files in Hierarchical Clustering:", sum(combined_df$Cluster.x == i), "\n")
  cat("Cluster", i, "files in KMeans Clustering:", sum(combined_df$Cluster.y == i), "\n\n")
}


```
```{r}

p_words <- colSums(dtm_matrix) / sum(dtm_matrix)

cluster_words <- lapply(unique(hclustering), function(x){
  rows <- dtm_matrix[hclustering == x, ]
  
  # For memory's sake, drop all words that don't appear in the cluster
  rows <- rows[, colSums(rows) > 0]
  
  colSums(rows) / sum(rows) - p_words[colnames(rows)]
})

cluster_summary <- data.frame(
  cluster = unique(hclustering),

Cluster 1 is  Political Topics:

Words like "will," "going," "people," and "country" suggest discussions about the future, the nation, and its people. Words like "want," "America," and "know" indicate expressions of desires, patriotism, and a quest for knowledge.

Cluster 2 is about Business and Management:

Words like "data," "example," and "management" indicate a focus on data and project management. Words like "however," "problem," and "point" suggest an emphasis on problem-solving and addressing challenges, possibly using specific tools or methods like "ibis."

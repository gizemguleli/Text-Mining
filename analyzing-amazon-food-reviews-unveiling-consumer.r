Initially,we focused on selecting relevant columns such as Id, ProductId, UserId, HelpfulnessNumerator, HelpfulnessDenominator, Score, Time, Summary, and Text while excluding any rows with missing values. This step ensured that we retained essential information for our analysis while maintaining data integrity. Subsequently, we prepared the text data within the reviews.df dataframe. Key transformations were applied to the Text column, including converting text to lowercase, removing unwanted characters such as newline characters (\\\\n), and eliminating specific patterns like HTML entities (&amp). Additionally, we addressed URLs by removing them along with hashtags and account mentions from the text.\n","##The aim of these preprocessing steps was to create a clean and standardized text corpus suitable for subsequent text mining and analysis tasks. we ensured a more consistent and focused textual dataset. Later we created a text corpus based on the Text column of the reviews.df dataframe.

The initial step involves creating a word frequency table (word.count) that showcases the top words and their respective counts. However, during execution, a warning related to outer names for unnamed scalar atomic inputs might appear. Despite this warning, the results remain accurate.\n","##The presented output reveals the top 10 words and their frequencies in the Amazon product reviews dataset. Notably, the term \"br\" with 16305 occurrences raises a flag for further investigation, as  it might be an artifact or noise introduced during the text cleaning and tokenization process. Common positive descriptors such as \"good,\" \"great,\" and specific product-related terms like \"coffee\" dominate the list, emphasizing the positive sentiment and product-focused nature of the reviews. Understanding these prevalent words guides subsequent threshold-setting processes, ensuring the exclusion of noise and irrelevant terms for more meaningful analyses.\n","\n","# Counting the most popular words in the reviews\n","stopwords.df <- tibble(\n","  word = c(stopwords(kind = 'en'))\n","  )\n","words.df <- reviews.df %>% \n","  unnest_tokens(input = Text, output = word) %>% \n","  anti_join(y = stopwords.df, by = 'word')\n","\n","word.count <- words.df %>% count(word, sort = TRUE)\n","\n","word.count %>% head(10)\n","\n","### Visualization  of the most frequently occurring words \n","\n","#In this section, our objective was to visually represent the most frequently occurring words in the reviews. We initiated the process by calculating the frequency of each word after tokenizing and eliminating stopwords from the review text, resulting in the creation of the word.count dataframe containing words and their respective frequencies. To highlight the most significant words, a count threshold of 3000 was established, guiding the subsequent analysis. The top word counts were then visualized through a bar plot (plt), where the x-axis denoted words and the y-axis represented their frequencies, showcasing only those surpassing the defined threshold. To further enhance the interactive exploration of the data, the bar plot was transformed into an interactive plot using ggplotly(). Additionally, a word cloud was generated using the wordcloud package, presenting a visually compelling representation of the most frequent words. The color palette chosen for the word cloud aimed to improve visibility and overall aesthetics. Throughout these steps, the determination of thresholds was intricately linked to the analysis of the output data at each stage, ensuring a judicious balance between inclusivity and the emphasis on pertinent information in the reviews.\n","\n","\n","# visualize these counts in a bar plot\n","plt <- word.count %>% \n","  # Set count threshold. \n","  filter(n > 3000) %>%\n","  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%\n","  ggplot(aes(x = word, y = n)) +\n","  theme_light() + \n","  geom_col(fill = 'lightcoral', alpha = 0.8) +\n","  xlab(NULL) +\n","  coord_flip() +\n"," ggtitle(\"Top Word Count\") +\n","  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, color = 'red', face = 'bold'))\n","\n","\n","plt %>% ggplotly()\n","\n","wordcloud(\n","  words = word.count$word, \n","  freq = word.count$n, \n","  min.freq = 3800, \n","  colors = brewer.pal(8, 'Dark2')\n",")\n","\n","\n","## Network Analyze\n","\n","\n","### Navigating Bigrams: Unveiling Word Companionships\n","\n","#In the bi-gram section, we analyze pairwise occurrences of words appearing together in the text. The goal is to identify meaningful associations between words and create a network representation of bigram relationships. We filter out stop words and white spaces, count the occurrences of each bigram, and visualize the distribution of their weights. To manage the skewed distribution, a log transformation is applied. A threshold is set to define the minimal weight allowed in the graph, and the resulting bigram network is visualized. The network is represented using a force-directed layout, with custom colors for vertex labels and a size scale based on the degree of each node.\n","\n","##The output displays the top bigrams based on their weights, representing the frequency of occurrence. Each row consists of two words (word1 and word2) forming a bigram, and the corresponding weight indicates the number of times that bigram appears in the text. For example, the bigram \"highly recommend\" has a weight of 898, indicating that this phrase is frequently used in the reviews. Similarly, other bigrams like \"peanut butter,\" \"taste like,\" and \"gluten-free\" are also common expressions. The table provides insights into meaningful word associations and recurring phrases in the analyzed text.\n","\n","\n","\n","# count pairwise occurrences of words which appear together in the text\n","bi.gram.words <- reviews.df %>% \n","  unnest_tokens(\n","    input = Text, \n","    output = bigram, \n","    token = 'ngrams', \n","    n = 2\n","  ) %>% \n","  filter(! is.na(bigram))\n","\n","bi.gram.words %>% \n","  select(bigram) %>% \n","  head(10)\n","\n","\n","\n","# filter for stop words and remove white spaces\n","bi.gram.words %<>% \n","  separate(col = bigram, into = c('word1', 'word2'), sep = ' ') %>% \n","  filter(! word1 %in% stopwords.df$word) %>% \n","  filter(! word2 %in% stopwords.df$word) %>% \n","  filter(! is.na(word1)) %>% \n","  filter(! is.na(word2)) \n","\n","# group and count by bigram\n","bi.gram.count <- bi.gram.words %>% \n","  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE) %>% \n","  # We rename the weight column so that the \n","  # associated network gets the weights (see below).\n","  rename(weight = n)\n","\n","bi.gram.count %>% head()\n","\n","\n","### Visualization of Bi-gram Results\n","\n","#In the normal bigram weight distribution plot, in the beginning we observe that the y-axis displays counts in scientific notation (e.g., 2e+05), which can be visually challenging. To address this, we modify the y-axis to display counts in a more readable format. Additionally, we enhance the visual appeal of the plots by introducing vibrant and customized colors, deviating from the default settings to make the graphs more engaging.\n","##Having plotted the normal bigram weight distribution, we observed a right-skewed distribution that prompted us to address readability issues in the y-axis counts by modifying the format. Due to the skewed nature of the distribution, we opted for a logarithmic transformation in the log-transformed bigram weight distribution plot. This transformation normalize the data  for better visualization and allowed better interpretation of the weight patterns in the bigrams.\n","###From these results, we confronted a trade-off between network inclusivity and the strength of connections. A higher threshold (around 500-550) emphasized fewer bigrams with robust associations, fostering a focused network. Conversely, a lower threshold (around 100-150) prioritized a more extensive network but potentially weaker connections. Opting for a medium threshold (300-350) struck a balance, incorporating a moderate number of bigrams (41-58) with average weights around 0.27. This choice aimed to capture a meaningful yet comprehensive representation of word associations in the Amazon product reviews, offering a nuanced perspective that considers both network strength and inclusivity. The chosen threshold, set at 350, was applied to the weights. We normalized the weights for better visualization by scaling them with a global factor. Using igraph, we created a network object and visualized it, adjusting parameters such as vertex size, color, and edge width. The resulting force-directed network plot provides a comprehensive view of significant bigram relationships, contributing to a deeper understanding of patterns within the dataset.\n","\n","\n","# Plotting the distribution of bigram weights (Normal)\n","bi.gram.count %>% \n","  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight)) +\n","    theme_minimal() +\n","    geom_histogram(color = \"skyblue\", fill = \"lightblue\", bins = 30) +\n","    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +  # Display counts with commas\n","    labs(\n","      title = \"Distribution of Bigram Weights\",\n","      x = \"Weight\",\n","      y = \"Count\"\n","    )\n","\n","\n","\n","# very skewed, for visualization purposes it might be a good idea to perform a transformation\n","# Plotting the distribution of log-transformed bigram weights\n","bi.gram.count %>% \n","  mutate(log_weight = log(weight + 1)) %>% \n","  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = log_weight)) +\n","    theme_minimal() +\n","    geom_histogram(color = \"salmon\", fill = \"lightcoral\", bins = 30) +\n","    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +  # Display counts with commas\n","    labs(\n","      title = \"Log-Transformed Distribution of Bigram Weights\",\n","      x = \"Log-Transformed Weight\",\n","      y = \"Count\"\n","    )\n","\n","\n","# Set the threshold\n","\n","threshold <- 350\n","\n","# For visualization purposes we scale by a global factor. \n","ScaleWeight <- function(x, lambda) {\n","  x / lambda\n","}\n","\n","network <-  bi.gram.count %>%\n","  filter(weight > threshold) %>%\n","  mutate(weight = ScaleWeight(x = weight, lambda = 2E3)) %>% \n","  graph_from_data_frame(directed = FALSE)\n","\n","network\n","\n","is.weighted(network)\n","\n","# Generate a palette of colors for vertex labels\n","label_colors <- rainbow(length(V(network)))\n","\n","# Plot the network with custom colors for vertex labels\n","plot(\n","  network, \n","  vertex.size = 1,\n","  vertex.label.color = label_colors,\n","  vertex.label.cex = 0.7, \n","  vertex.label.dist = 1,\n","  vertex.color = 'white',  # Set vertex color to white\n","  edge.color = 'gray', \n","  main = 'Bigram Count Network', \n","  sub = glue('Weight Threshold: {threshold}'), \n","  alpha = 50\n",")\n","\n","\n","#Set threshold\n","threshold <- 350\n","\n","network <-  bi.gram.count %>%\n","  filter(weight > threshold) %>%\n","  graph_from_data_frame(directed = FALSE)\n","\n","# Store the degree.\n","V(network)$degree <- strength(graph = network)\n","# Compute the weight shares.\n","E(network)$width <- E(network)$weight/max(E(network)$weight)\n","\n","# Create networkD3 object.\n","network.D3 <- igraph_to_networkD3(g = network)\n","# Define node size.\n","network.D3$nodes %<>% mutate(Degree = (1E-2)*V(network)$degree)\n","# Degine color group (I will explore this feature later).\n","network.D3$nodes %<>% mutate(Group = 1)\n","# Define edges width. \n","network.D3$links$Width <- 10*E(network)$width\n","\n","forceNetwork(\n","  Links = network.D3$links, \n","  Nodes = network.D3$nodes, \n","  Source = 'source', \n","  Target = 'target',\n","  NodeID = 'name',\n","  Group = 'Group', \n","  opacity = 0.9,\n","  Value = 'Width',\n","  Nodesize = 'Degree', \n","  # We input a JavaScript function.\n","  linkWidth = JS(\"function(d) { return Math.sqrt(d.value); }\"), \n","  fontSize = 12,\n","  zoom = TRUE, \n","  opacityNoHover = 1\n",")\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","### Skip-grams: Bridging Gaps in Word Connections\n","\n","##In this section, we extend our analysis by considering skipgrams, which allow for a \"jump\" in the word count.
